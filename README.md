# Airports in the United States

This project is a map of the airports in the United States including it's territories including Puerto Rico. This map shows the locations of each airport with a pop-up feature of the location when clicked on. I used a choropleth map to show the density of airports in each state or territory. Each airport is also labeled whether they have an air traffic control tower or not.
